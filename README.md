# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Your Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule

## Acceptance Criteria

The app should:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page

## Usage

A planning scheduler website can be useful because it provides a centralized platform for individuals and teams to organize, prioritize, and schedule tasks and events. This can increase efficiency, reduce the likelihood of scheduling conflicts, and help ensure that deadlines are met. Additionally, many planning scheduler websites offer features such as email notifications, task delegations, and collaboration tools, making it easier to coordinate with others and keep track of progress.
